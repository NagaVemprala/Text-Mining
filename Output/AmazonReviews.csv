"1","Very easy to understand and learn the basics.
However, there were a few typos that caused confusion.

Update 3/3/2020
Company got in contact and corrected the errors that I found."
"2","Good examples and useful for coding beginners or experienced people who are wanting to learn SQL. 80% of the book is on querying approaches, and the last sections are on views and database record updating. If you type and work all examples and do all challenges, maybe 15-25 hours of work depending on your skill...but a very productive 15-25 hours."
"3","I got the printed version. The e-version is probably just as good. This book enabled me to learn to do basic SQL queries. I'm not a techy person by any means, and I took several online tutorials, but found them confusing. I was unable to do the ""homework"" except for the most simple problems.

After using the book, I was able to query what I needed from my databases at work. I even surpassed the queries that others had done before me by cleaning them up.

The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of the lessons didn't work in my DB. Some of the functions are different in different versions of SQL.

I'd highly recommend this if you're a beginner with queries. Downloading the practice DB is easy. It was also helpful for me to learn a bit of DB background and syntax that the other online lessons didn't address."
"4","Great book! Includes free audio book, sample database, SQL Software download, SQL statement references, and video tutorials."
"5","I've done a fair amount of programming in Java, storing and retrieving data through jdbc and various database vendors. After reading this book, the database, and SQL in particular, have now become far more interesting. It's the way the book is written. The author describes the importance of data in a free and unpretentious language. Explanations are not tedious - they are interesting and useful. So much talk about NoSQL today, but after reading this I'm going to dig into more SQL."
"6","Fantastic beginner reference. Easy to understand and most importantly PRACTICAL with examples and exercises to do. I have had a couple of starts and stops with SQL, but this was easy to stick to...and the best reference for going back to. Thank you!!"
"7","My wife will write this review:
I have an accounting degree. The one thing I wish my college had focused more on was the software frequently used by accountants/accounts payable employees. After reading this book, I feel as though I could easily use SQL in a work setting. I can put it on my resume to say that am ""knowledgeable"" in the software. Although I still have no experience, I can get an employers attention by stating that I know how to use the software.

I think this is good for someone who needs to know enough to get started. I've never worked with the software before in my life. So it's definitely a good beginners guide. The descriptions are clear and concise. I will probably keep it as a reference guide for any job in which I use this software.

It is not overly long so it doesn't take days to sift through complicated material. Overall, a great purchase."
"8","This book is really good if you are looking for a beginners guide in sql this would be the book i would choose. This has the very basics in sql like how to create, insert and delete tables in a sql database. It also gives us knowledge on how to pose queries that we are dealing with in sql. How to join tables and read the questions and how to convert them into sql queries. There are many examples and practice exercises to get a complete grip on sql commands and queries. If you are beginner in computer sciences and would like basic knowledge on databases and sql i would highly suggest buying this book. It also has complex commands and the end for creating views for your queries which are very good. It also helps you understand normalisation and how different companies use different normalisations and helps classify them so you get a good understanding on the topic. I do not see any complaints on the contents of this book so i am giving it 5 stars. I got this product for free in exchange for a unbiased review of the book. It took me a month to go through the book and gave it best unbiased review."
"9","I am self-taught, but very rusty. This book does a great job of providing the basics of SQL query writing and gives good explanations. The data set that comes with it is also nice. My one complaint is that there are typos throughout the book, some of which caused confusion, but I was able to figure it out. Another reviewer also commented on this and said the typos were fixed, but it doesn't seem to be the standard file that is downloaded from Amazon - hence the 4 out of 5 rating. I still highly recommend this book for anybody wanting to learn or brush up on their SQL skills.

It would be nice if there were some more advanced queries added to the book or otherwise provided by the publisher. However, to the publisher's credit, when I did ask about this they sent a great email providing several sites that I could go to for further SQL development."
"10","I've been through more than 2/3 of this book and it has been excellent. The instructions are very clear and it is giving me an excellent introduction to SQL."
"11","I'm about halfway through this book. I have a condition that makes it hard to read. This book does a good job of teaching SQLite but spends too much time stressing the importance of comments and style. I agree, that these things are important, however, not to the audience of the book.

The reader would have been better served by getting into the grit of SQL syntax and which keywords to use when versus ensuring that every query had a comment block with name, date, and description. Moreover, requiring every reader to download a prewritten database to work from and special utilities to follow along takes away from the learning experience.

That said, you will learn the basics about SQLite, and by the end of the book be able to handle most problems you'll encounter when developing an application."
"12","It's a well-written introduction to the language, and it features some useful explanations and definitions, especially about the aggregate functions. It was useful to help me get back into SQL after a year off filling my head with Python. It loses a star, however, because = ( 'it a book about SQLite' AND 'it is deceptive about this point' )

Now, SQLite is actually great to learn SQL concepts with (I did this myself a few years back), but the book and/or advertising donesn't make note of this. The book just proclaims itself as 'SQL', even though SQLite lack some features of the full-fledged SQL flavors. SQLite's training wheels are good for an absolute beginner (and the book is certainly a quality product), but I wouldn't have picked it up if I had known what I was purchasing."
"13","I have “used” sql at my job for many years now, but have never really understood it. I have always relied on other people to write my queries. This book puts it in layman’s terms. For example why the heck do they always use *. Hello, because it stands for all fields. Who knew. I didn’t until I read this book. If you have been exposed to SQL, but have never been trained on how to write queries, I strongly suggest you purchase this book. It is worth every penny."
"14","Positive: This has to be one of the easiest-to-read books on the subject. Material is well-organized and clearly explained.

Negative: Some material is grossly oversimplified. In particular: (1) There is no discussion of concurrency. (2) Although the book concentrates on SQLite, a key limitation of that product--limited concurrency--is never mentioned."
"15","I finished through the content of this book about a week ago and can say that this was a really great book. The chapters were to the point, not too dry, and really expanded my knowledge on SQL. This book is great for non-technical professionals who are maybe more focused on business management, accounting, or finance. I am going to continue to use this book as a constant refresher to the knowledge that I gained. Definitely a good purchase and would recommend this to anyone trying to further their knowledge when it comes to data and IT."
"16","I opted for a book over an online course and this was a really great choice. If you're just starting out in SQL and want a well-written, thorough but not dry guide, I highly recommend this product. You definitely need more practice than what the book offers, but there's lots of resources online for that."
"17","I bought this book to learn SQL, because I may need to use SQL in an upcoming work project. I have studied up to page 108 out of 180 pages.
So far, it is excellent. It starts with basic concepts and adds skills layer by layer. The database that comes free with it is full of interesting info. It has good practice examples."
"18","This is a very clearly written and excellent introduction to writing queries for databases. The included sample database and practice exercises in particular make it a superb learning tool. Things do not get very advanced however, and it is a relatively short book as far as technical tomes go. But for the vast majority of people looking to just pull data it may well be all you need.

If you hope to work as a full data analyst however you will certainly need to move on to more advanced learning resources after this."
"19","I got this to help me learn SQL. I had Oracle and decided to use this book to help me understand - the differences are not that big. I ended up installing SQLite, and I'm now using that instead of Oracle.

This book is very straightforward and easy to understand!"
"20","Sink hole of heavy-handed ads at book end allow no opportunity to opt out only allow to “accept and close.” I wanted not part of baited offers, gimmicks and attendant email avalanche, especially as access to promised downloadable assets failed to arrive. Disappointed."
"21","I'm new to coding and data analysis. This book has been very very helpful--clearly and economically written so that it functions well as both a textbook and a reference guide. Detailed solutions to all the exercises ensure that you will understand why they're done the way they're done. I chose this book out of all the other SQL manuals sight unseen based on reviews, and I'm very glad I did."
"22","I am so excited about this guide. I was apprehensive about learning SQL but with the simple step by step clear and concise explanations and instructions in this book, I learned more in a few hours reading the first few chapters than I have in the same amount of time from other videos and books. I needed a quick way to obtained this information to start a new career and I feel I am well on my way to accomplishing my goal as I develop my skills."
"23","I wanted to buy a handbook about SQL database management, turns out it's a fraud! The cover says SQL, but the content says 'the art of ritual!
Can you believe it?"
"24","Very well written and simple to understand. Very good starter for those that want to get some of the basic concepts down and jump right into practicing. If only some other topics can be written by this same author."
"25","I was looking for an overview of SQL so that I can talk the talk with my tech team and this fit the bill. It was a relatively short read with great examples. It can also serve as a good jumping-off point for anyone interested in learning more. There were a few typos as other have said, but nothing too egregious. Also, the links to the Northwind database and the free audiobook need to be updated though I didn't feel shortchanged by not having access to the database."
"26","The commands are taught for SQLite and every easy to follow (even covering all the pitfalls). But it is easy to translate them to Postsqlgre (just remember to have field names in quotation marks). The pace of the book is great and I learned a lot."
"27","Easy read and very informative. Gets you all the basics to start and enough complexity to make it worth while to read."
"28","I'm working through the kindle version while awaiting the paperback. The content seems good, but I would stay away from the kindle version. It reads like somone took the original text, cut it up in sections and then put those sections back in the wrong order. Very disjointed. I hope the hardcopy isn't like this."
"29","I love this book. The author takes a complex subject and simplifies it. He is easy to follow. I am so thankful for Walter Shields! You will be too, if you purchase this book. <U+0001F601><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>"
"30","The book is just brilliant! It is very well detailed, easy to understand with great examples and you get to practice with the actual software step by step, which makes it the perfect book for beginners and people who already have some knowledge in SQL. Before purchasing the book I tried with some online courses but they were just boring and lacked context which resulted in me leaving them aside.
Since I started reading this book I haven't stopped, the author made and excellent job writing it, as it's easy to read and very interesting.
This was a great investment and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to start learning SQL."
"31","The book has everything I needed to understand the syntax and start working with SQL."
"32","This book does an excellent job providing an overview of the necessities in SQL. The author structures it in such a way that you can read from beginning to end, building skills along the way. Surprisingly, for a book on SQL, it is somewhat entertaining and easy/quick."
"33","Super helpful and effective format &tips!"
"34","This is a best seller for a reason. You can't make SQL any simpler than this. Well done brother."
"35","Well-written with a lot of examples and practice. The author has a common-sense approach which I found encouraging and not overwhelming."
"36","Well worth the money"
"37","SQL QuickStart Guide was an excellent read. I learned a great deal from the book and practice dataset. Thanks much."
"38","Really enjoying the content of the book. Gives great examples and breaks things down for a beginner to easily comprehend and follow. Would highly recommend this book. Looking forward to purchasing others in the future."
"39","I’ve used SQL before but it’s been years since I last used the skill set. This is definitely a great book for a refresher and even if you are a beginner. It covers pretty much everything you need to be successful in a career that involves SQL."
"40","This book is almost useless! It does not even teach you how to install or get access to database for practice SQL."
"41","The free promotional items the company offers you just for acquiring this product by yourself make it definitely worth the five stars I have offered it, as well as the product is amazing. I should start by remembering that I gotten this product about 5 days ago and I am currently halfway done with it. This is not a guide that explains the very essentials of pc programming and assumes that you already have a fundamental grasp of your fundamentals including arrays you definitely should if you are even slightest little bit interested in discovering SQL. It begins by teaching you in regards to what the program is, how it has become a highly valued skill on the planet, and why it is a far better programming language than others. It can make a terminology that most men and women consider very advanced and more and more difficult the more you employ it very simple to grasp in a way that could potentially change your entire career. I am not much of a computer science expert myself and have only a basic idea of programming language, mostly java, but I surely could read this reserve and comprehend almost all of it without a difficulty. My pc science buddies are even surprised by just how much I managed to learn about this programming words that they think about impossible in such a short amount of time. I highly recommend this product if you have any attention at all in mastering a new coding language or maybe giving on your own another ability because they help it become very simple to learn. Disclosure: I received the product for free or on a promo discount for my sincere review and are generally 100% my very own opinions. Nonetheless everyone has their very own opinion on this product.

"68","I really appreciated reading this quick start book to SQL. Ashamed to say that I have dealt with many databases, macros, etc but cannot tell you the formal name nor exactly why things work the way they do. I started to noticing that I really was not familiar with and methods. I was outdated in information and desperately needed to learn and freshen up my vocabulary.

This book helped me tremendously and was an easy read.

"93","Prior to reading the ""SQL QuickStart Guide"", I knew nothing whatever about SQL, except that it was used with databases. This review reflects the experience of a beginner wishing to learn a new language.

In return for a review, I Was offered the ebook for download. I was able to download the book without difficulty to both my Macintosh computer and to my Kindle Fire. A direct download to my Paperwhite Kindle was apparently successful, but the device could not open the downloaded file. I was able, however, to transfer the book from my computer to either Kindle without difficulty.

Although the text was attractive in the Paperwhite Kindle, the tables were so tiny that a magnifying glass was necessary to read them. The Kindle Fire allowed me to magnify the tables, as did my computer. The ebook is substantially cheaper than either the paperback or the hardback, but the book needs to be read on a device that allows zooming in on the tables.

I had no difficulty downloading the sTunes Database and the DB Browser for SQLite from the publisher's website. Both are necessary to use the book effectively.

The author's English is informal, fluent, and articulate. The book does not read like a technical manual. He was careful to define technical terms as they occurred and provided a glossary at the back of the book. There is a detailed Table of Contents. The ebook did not include an index, since the digital text could be searched directly. I do not know if there is an index in the paperback and hardback editions.

The results of SQL queries were shown in the earlier chapters, but less often in the later ones, after the reader had become accustomed to the SQLite browser.

It is difficult to rid a technical book entirely of misprints, and there are a few in the ""SQL QuickStart Guide."" The only one that impeded my progress was an error in figure 65, where the primary key for invoice_items, ""InvoiceLineId"", was printed as ""InvoiceItemId"". The publisher is in the process of setting up, on their website, an ""Errata"" page for this and other technical manuals.

There are two appendices. The first provides solutions to the Data Analysis questions asked at the ends of the technical chapters. The questions were not difficult, but the answers were welcome. The second appendix summarizes the keywords introduced in chapters 4 through 10. An expansion of this appendix would be helpful.

In addition to the technical information in Chapters 3 through 10, the author provides information about himself, SQL, and careers in data access and analysis.

To summarize, I was able to work my way through the book in two weeks, so it did an excellent job of providing a beginner with a working knowledge of SQL. I look forward to trying out my new skills on another database."
"94","This is a wonderful book on getting started with the SQL programming language. The breakdown of the book into sections that allow the reader to come back and refer to sections as they grow in their skillset or need a refresher shows a great deal about how the author (Walter) understands his students and has been teaching for a while. His background story is inspiring and provides reasoning why he put so much into this quality material. I found the examples easy to follow and the example code also good. I have been a database professional for over twenty years and I get asked a lot about books to help those starting out. I recommend this book for those wanting a solid understanding and some good examples that can be applied to work/school."
"95","I've used this Kindle version to study all of the examples from front too back.

You can download a sample database for a music store and browser called DBbrowser from the Clydebank publisher. The database has 14 tables you can use to test your SQL code.

Here's a great way to study from the Kindle book
-o- Open the book in your laptop/desktop Kindle reader on the left side of your monitor.
-o- Open the DBbrowser included with the book supplement

Comb through the book chapter by chapter and test the SQL snippets yourself.

The author provides comments on the SQL statements that come from his corporate experience.

I'd buy this again.
This is a well organized, easy to follow introduction to the SQL language."
"96","This is the perfect starter's guide for anyone completely new to SQL. I work with MS SQL daily. I have literally read dozens of books and attended numerous SQL courses. Although I am myself now proficient in SQL, I'm always looking for the easiest way to teach it to people who I work with that have no SQL experience whatsoever. The single biggest problem with every book I've tried up to this point is how they overcomplicate simple descriptions. Even the my ""Teach yourself SQL in 10 minutes"" is way too wordy at times. This truly is a ""SIMPLIFIED"" beginner's guide, just as it's titled. The best part about this book is it gets right down to the nitty gritty. It doesn't confuse you by throwing a ton of superfluous info at you all at once. It basically reads as such: ""This is something you can do; this is why you do it; and this is how you do it"". It's as simple as that. For example, in the chapter about joins, this guide quickly says why you need a join (to combine data from two tables based on a common record), the different type of joins and terminologies with simple examples: Inner, outer, left, right, full, etc. You really get up to speed on joins fairly quickly. By comparison, the ""10 minute"" guide first goes into a long-winded explanation about relational tables, then another chapter about why you should use joins and then, finally it gets into examples. That's pretty much the difference with everything between this guide and most of the other ""easy"" or ""quick"" guides. This guide actually lives up to those claims. Even if you're a a moderately experienced SQL user, it makes a great pocket reference. If you have a pretty good amount of SQL experience, this book won't be much benefit because you almost certainly already know everything in it.

I'm not saying the 10-minute guide and similar books are bad. Not at all. It is definitely important to learn the mechanics, reasoning and logic behind the actions you perform. You absolutely should eventually learn how relational databases work and build a strong foundation of the fundamentals of SQL or you'll eventually run into problems once you start creating more complex queries and stored procedures. Even some simple but very important fundamentals like using aliases and subqueries with WHERE clause while knowing the order in which SQL processes data are better explained in books like ""10 minutes"". However, if you have a project coming due or were just tasked with working with SQL (it happens quite frequently believe it or not) and need to get up to speed as fast as possible without all the fluff, this is your best bet. During my very first SQL class a few years ago, I was instructed to purchase the official Microsoft guide to querying SQL Server. I'm sorry, but that book was the absolute worst recommendation to someone completely new to SQL. To this day, I don't think I've read more than 10 pages of it because it reads like an overly complicated technical manual. This is the best introduction to SQL that I've found to date. It really helps you hit the ground running.

That's not to say it's perfect. The table of contents could use some tweaking to fine-tune it down to individual topics instead of overly broad scopes, at least in the Kindle version that I have. The topics are individually listed in the sample but on my Kindle, there are only four chapters with no way to select subtopics. For instance, in the sample, it has ""Chapter 1: Retrieving Data With SQL"" and has sixteen sub-topics including SELECT, FROM, TOP WHERE, ORDER BY, NULL, etc. On my Kindle, it simply says Chapter 1: Retrieving Data With SQL and nothing more. There are no sub-topics you can quickly click. You have to read through the chapter an bookmark each topic to get to it faster later. I don't know if this is an issue with all Kindle versions or just mine but it's worth mentioning. Also, as I said, if you really want to learn all the ins and outs of SQL, you'll want a more detailed book. Just make sure it's not way too detailed. There are also a ton of free SQL resources and free courses online as well. If you do a web search for ""learn SQL"" you'll find tons of good resources that will compliment this very reasonably priced book."
"97","I am a senior sql developer with decades of experience, and was happy to review this book for accuracy. It is a great way for a beginner to learn the basics of sql databases. Also the reader is directed to use sqlite, which is absolutely free. So there is no barrier to have to buy any products or licensing. The exercises in the book are also available on the author's web page, which is a big help."
"98","This book is and does exactly what it claims to be and to do. It provides the database novice the necessary basics for analyzing, manipulating, and managing an RDBMS using SQL. It is a very good introductory first step and provides cogent exercises for the reader to develop SQL competence via real world exercises using a convenient downloadable fully populated database. I recommend this book to anyone interested in getting their toes wet in the world of SQL and RDBMS. This review is for the eBook version."
"99","One of the biggest hurdles to learning programming languages is getting over the technical jargon. It's a real challenge but, Walter Shields has made SQL concepts and query writing so accessible in this book. Sometimes technical authors put their foot in their own way with their communications styles - both written and verbal. However, this book reads like a Sunday newspaper-- very clear but substantial.

I was not sure what to expect when I bought this book. But, I can literally write SQL queries after reading this book. Don't underestimate this book and conclude that you will only learn a few useless statements and that's it. This book will teach you how to listen to your organization's business needs and how to use SQL to translate them into a solution.

I use to listen to Data Scientists in awe and confusion. But, now I feel like I can communicate with the best SQL experts.

BUY THIS BOOK!"
"100","I came to this book with no SQL experience, and very little database experience at all--but I have moderate experience with HTML, Excel, and a little tiny bit of programming. The guide is very well organized and easy to get into, from the beginning (how to get started with a free version of a SQL program) and forward through clear exercises of increasing complexity. Highly recommended to anyone interested in getting their feet wet in SQL!
(Note: I received a free copy of this book thanks to the LibraryThing Early Reviewers program)"
"101","In more than 30 years of purchasing and using computer and IT textbooks and instruction manuals, I have to say that this one is the most valuable and useful. Most of the credit goes to the author, who writes in a conversational style while at the same time, does not waste his words. He is a gifted teacher. The book is available in different formats, and I recommend the spiral-bound version, which makes the book useful while you are learning or working. It has always puzzled me why textbooks and so many of the gargantuan instruction manuals are not published spiral bound. It is practically impossible to use them while you are trying to follow their instructions."
"102","Excellent book. I actually know SQL and have a great deal of experience with it (18 years). So, I'm very qualified to review this book. I haven't worked with SQL, though, in two years. Which is why I wanted this book. A refresher. Plus, I think even the experienced can learn something from someone who has written about a topic exceedingly well. I did learn a great deal. The author writes in a way that is lacking from nearly every technical book on the market. His explanations, style of writing, everything, are fantastic. I only wished he wrote all the technical books I needed to read or want to own! Fantastic guide to have on hand. I have it on my computer and on my phone so that I'm never without out."
"103","The author's passion for teaching comes through in the organization of the guide! The Quick Start Guide allows the beginners to jump in and start learning (the best way to learn, in my estimation); users with some experience will enjoy the guide as a good tool to review the key elements of working with data.

The concepts, terminology, and the tools are configured well to help the beginner to tackle the learning while keeping the information accessible (the book doesn't throw a lot of jargon at you which can be intimidating for a beginner); as a result, the user can practice, make mistakes, and learn in a safe way, leading to absorbing the material and gaining confidence.

The use of SQL is broken down into the logical components so the user can understand how to use it to get to the desired output. The end goal, after all, is to use the tool/data to be able to build expertise in analyzing to get insights into what the data has in store. This is the key expertise for all data-related skills needed in the marketplace."
"104","I received a copy of the book on request. I have a working knowledge of SQL, but have occasions to recommend good training and teaching material. The author states he is the son of an educator in literature and it shows. He is articulate and concise, giving the information needed without excess verbiage and fluff. He shows good teaching ability himself anticipating problems that could be encountered and shortcuts students (readers) might take and gives appropriate solutions. Exercises at the end of chapters are stretching, regularly posing questions the answers for which have not yet been given, but soon will be. The book would make a good reference for beginning to intermediate SQL users. Anyone with an interest in, or need for understanding SQL would benefit from reading the book and using it as a training guide."
"105","I am starting chapter 4 and I really like the teaching style of the author: simple, concise, and understandable with lots of supporting figures. An important element of Shield's teaching style is repetition. In learning new material this is an important element and Shields handles it gracefully.
A benefit I hadn't expected is access to lots of supporting materials such as cheat sheets, videos, software links, and instructions on installing DB Browser for SQLite along with a practice file used in the Guide.
It is exactly what the title says: A Quick Start Guide.
Overall: this Guide is done very nicely."
"106","I want to start this review by mentioning that I did not have any experience or prior knowledge of this particular topic prior to reading this book. I do not have any kind of background in SQL whatsoever so its difficult for me to gauge the knowledge itself that you get from this book. However, I would like to mention that this book is easy to read. I want to mention this first because this is the most important factor to me in trying to read a text for the knowledge and not for entertainment purposes, etc. The language is easy to follow and understand. I've had a lot of trouble with books about various aspects of technology in the past because I don't know the jargon and other technical language and the concepts the language represents. This book is actually great in that its easy to follow and it isn't filled with technical language and jargon that make it difficult to follow. I think that most people should have no trouble reading this text and making sense of it because it isn't necessarily written for only the people who already have a background in SQL. SQL is Structured Query Language. Its a computer programming language ""designed for managing data"" or ""for stream processing"" in specific data management systems. I think this is a great place to start if you don't have any prior learning with programming language and even better if you do have some background. Either way, its useful knowledge to have and the book is a comprehensive breakdown of the concepts that walks you completely through everything that you need to know.
I do have to mention that I received this book either for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review (the Kindle version is free to anyone anyway and you can use the product link to read it whenever you want) and this review accurately reflects my thoughts, opinions, and observations of this particular product."
"107","I've read a lot of different SQL books for reference and referral purposes, and this one stands out. Walter Shields truly understands how to present and teach SQL. His explanations are presented in a non-techie style while at the same time, he builds on the last, bite-sized, example script. He presents SQL in a fun way but makes sure the underlying principle of what he is talking about comes through. If you are considering getting into the world of SQL, this book will take you from the very basics to having a good understanding of what SQL is all about. Mr. Shield truly knows how to teach and present the basics of SQL and I recommend his book if you are at all curious about SQL."
"108","I thought this book was interesting and had good information on SQL. I personally have found out through this book that I don't want to go into SQL, however, if you're interested in that field, this book would be a good one to read. If you do read this book be sure to read it when you're fully awake and can interact with the sample database (otherwise you'll make simple mistakes and get really frustrated)!
I received this book in exchange for an honest review from the LibraryThing Early Reviewers."
"109","This is the solid starter's guide for anyone completely new to SQL or someone needing a refresher. I work with SQL off and on and although I have read many books and taken courses, I find myself needing refreshers quite often. I'm always looking for the easiest way to demonstrate and work with coworkers that have little or no SQL experience whatsoever, the teach a person to fish method. I find many books too complicated or long, while this quick start guide is ""simplified"" to the point that any one of any experience can follow and learn the basics easily and quickly.

When I teach someone how to do something, I use three steps and this book does the same - ""this is what I want to do, this is why I want to do ti and this is how you do it"". Simply put, this is the best way to learn a logical programming language. The book covers the terminology and the basic actions needed to perform queries that are useful, rather than just loading everything. It's as simple as that. """"Easy"" or ""quick"" guides should be just that, especially when used by someone like me as a reference. This guide is that, so even experienced SQL users will get value.

"110","Disclaimer: I received this product at no cost from the seller for the purpose of providing a thorough and honest review.

Other than having taken some introductory computer science courses and working with MATLAB in college (which is not really programming), I am not a pro at programming by any means. However I have the basic knowledge of Object Oriented Languages like Java and C++ so I'm not a complete beginner either. From this intermediate level of knowledge, I was able to understand the content of this little book perfectly. I can't speak to the accuracy of any of this so I'm putting my faith in the authors.

As someone going into this knowing nothing about SQL, the writing is not tedious or academic enough to be daunting. In fact, I can tell the author really tried to dumb things down (in this case not a bad thing at all) and broken things out into quick, short sentences, sort of like ""A is B. B works well with C and D. This is because E."" If you take short notes along the line and review at the end of your session (2 hours at most if you go about it slow), you will understand it easily enough.

Now it really is a quick read and not meant to be a thorough tome of knowledge for SQL by any means whatsoever. You will not be able to go out and claim you can use SQL like a pro and get a job right after...however, if you're a project manager like me and needs a crash course to be able to talk intelligently with your programmers, then this will be a great book to start. Hopefully you have a chance to truly go into the trenches so to speak and really practice the stuff you read about here in the book.

My only criticism would be to include more pictures and diagrams, but I have a visual learner's bias, I suppose. The format is almost 90%+ black and white text. It isn't a fancy textbook with all sorts of side notes. It really is just a crash course written quickly (but eloquently) by an expert, that's my impression, at least."
"111","I liked this beginner's guide to SQL. I've been looking for an affordable introduction to SQL for my friends, and so that's why I read it. This is a great choice, and I'm going to recommend it to my friends for a quick into to SQL. It's really understandable, and gives the basics of SQL that apply to most SQL instances. The examples use the Northwind database, which is available on Access and SQL Server, and you can easily find scripts to make it on Oracle or other databases.

I would have rather had a book that focused 100% on select statements, rather than half of it being about database creation and updating. A newbie isn't going to be making a database. They're going to spend all of their time querying the database first.

I would definitely get this book, but I'd get a couple other SQL books at the same time, because you'll still be a little confused after reading it, if you don't already know SQL.

Pros:
+Simply covers the basics of SQL
+Short book
+Examples with the Northwind database
+Pretty easy to understand

Cons:
-You have to install the Microsoft Northwind database to use the examples
-Covers too much about database creation"
"112","I wanted this book to learn a new programming language for the fun of it and to help my husband with his new job. I found this book to be easy to follow with plenty of information to learn the coding language. The book is a manageable length and not bogged down in a lot of technical computer jargon. It is written in plain text with topics clearly labeled in bold. There is a small glossary at the end in case you forget what one of the necessary technical words means. The sequence of the information was logical. The examples were easy to follow and understand. Using the examples they provided in the book, I was able to start coding immediately using Microsoft SQL Server Express (it's free) and Microsoft Access. I did not mind the amount of time spent on database set up as I have no experience with SQL. As I get into the more advanced database entry coding, I will be turing to this book as a great reference to not only learn from, but also use to review. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs a quick start guide to the SQL programming language.

"113","I received this book via PC Kindle. This is a short book-easy read- on the basics of SQL. I have done a lot with several different programming languages. Before diving into one language deep, I wanted basics in several to see which one to pick to really get involved.

This book is very well written to show how to retrieve data and create databases. It is like it is advertised "" quick start guide"". I found this topic very interesting and this book makes it easy to understand.

"114","I got the kindle version of the book which is not very long, not sure if the physical book is longer. Anyway, this book I will say is ideal for beginners. Its starts by explaining what is a database and how they are structured. This concept is fundamental if one is to fully underatand databases and how to build and or query/retrieve meaningful information. The sample database used throughout the book is Northwind Traders which comes with Microsoft Office, so most people would have access to this database to follow and practice the examples.

It explains what is SQL, what is a query and how to use queries to retrieve information from the raw data in the database. The different SQL statements used to query and retrieve information from the databse were simple and very easy to understand and follow. The syntax was explained well and many examples were given like querying 1 table or several tables using joins, using functions to retrieve aggregiate data and modifying data by inserting, updating or deleting.

It's not a long winded book that gets you bored half way through, the explanations for each method of manipulating a database to get or update information are simple and easy to understand. This book is a good foundation to the subject. I would recommend this book to beginners or anyone who wants a simple refresher on the basic mechanics on querying a database.

I received the Kindle version of the book free for my honest and unbiased review."
"115","Full Disclaimer, I was lucky enough to be selected to review and rate this title for a discounted price. With that being said, I am still happy to provide my honest review for this text.

The great thing about the SQL: Quickstart Guide is that it helps you get straight to the learning and application portion of an SQL database. With a short overview and introduction chapter, I was able to quickly download the sample database that was provided (The link was broken but a quick Google Search yielded my result) and quickly dove into chapter 1 without any problems. A major strength is that example statements are provided throughout the entire book, so you can start exploring SQL by practicing with the various statements while having the ability to copy/paste them if need be. Result pictures are also provided with a majority of the statement example listed throughout the book. This allowed me to see if I was gathering the correct data or making a mistake along the way. Another strength is that it starts out easy and becomes more advanced as you start to learn and explore the different features that are found within the database. The book starts us out with the very simple *select* command and gradually evolves to selecting multiple items and even creating your own tables just from statements. The text also does a great job on explaining why you are using the different keywords in each statement. Rather than just listing a bunch of examples and pictures, the text actually describes why keywords are being used and how the data retrieved is being reflected.

Just as the title suggests, this book is more of a quickstart guide that is focused toward beginners. Many of the statement examples will provide the ground work for future SQL products to come. By no means does it harm the value of the book, but if you are looking for more advanced SQL features and development, other books should be purchased. If you are a beginner to SQL or just want a refresher on the various statements that exist, this may be the perfect book to refresh your memory."
"116","Full Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

This guide is an excellent choice for beginners who may have a general understanding of SQL but want to start writing and running their own queries. It's also a good choice for developers who don't use SQL daily and want to brush up on not only the language but also the concepts behind how relational database management systems work. I took an Introduction to Databases class in college several years ago and while what I learned in class went beyond the scope of this book, I still found it useful to have on hand to brush up on my skills again before starting an advanced database class online. I imagine I will continue to reference it in the future so I can refresh my memory on database concepts and also to compare traditional database designs with newer ideas such as ""NoSQL"" databases.

If you have little to no experience with coding or databases you may want to seek out a more in-depth book that builds up the concepts more gradually. Also if you have a good grasp of beginning SQL concepts and are seeking a book for more advanced coding examples you may find this too basic."
"117","I've only ever dabbled in database software and programming, never really getting my feet wet. I saw this book as an opportunity to try out something new and see what I could accomplish. This book does a really good job of starting you out by defining terms, concepts, and ideas, which I really appreciated. By the end of the book, you've created a basic database and have the tools needed to turn it into useful output.

Keep in mind that this book does not at all say it's going to turn you into a master, but rather it gets you started down the path to learn how to use SQL to create and access databases. Overall, it's a great way to get started and, in my personal opinion, get you excited to learn a new set of tools in programming.

In the end, this is great for people like me who have some programming knowledge - both web programming and software development - who want to give something new a chance. It's very well written and incredibly simple to understand. I had a blast getting through it and look forward to trying out SQL to create some applications for my current job to help streamline and organize our employee data. It explains how to store data in a database then access it using the metadata about that data. It shows you how to create tables from your databases, then how to parse the data in those tables to become usable, visual representations in your applications.

"118","This guide combines great workbook exercises with real world applications for what you're learning. So not only do you make sure you're retaining what you've learned through the exercises. You're learning how to apply your new knowledge in the real world."
"119","First off I’m reviewing the Kindle edition not that it really makes much of a difference. Except you can see where other people have highlighted passages that they thought were important, which is always nice to see.
So anyways, on to the review of the actual book. Now I’ve taken a course on SQL before but it was almost two years ago and really only a two week long “boot camp” style course through work. We were taught enough to be dangerous but really just focused on the couple of tasks we were going to be responsible for. Needless to say I have forgotten more then I remember about what they taught us there. So when I got this book I did not open it as a complete SQL noob. This book was really easy to understand, they put everything in easy to relate to format. After having read the book I am much more comfortable with SQL again and I feel like this will definitely help me at work. Might even be able to speed a few processes up!!
I received this product either at a discount or for free so I could try it and write an honest review. I have done so, and all opinions are based on my actual experience and not influenced by the price."
"120","Full Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I was looking for a book that introduced me to SWL beyond my pretty crappy basic knowledge. I wasn't looking into indepth information about SQL and found exactly what I was looking for in this book.

It starts off with creation and administration of SQL databases which a lot of started guides ommit. I thought it was great it was included here since while I know how to do that, some of my friends who want to learn with me don't and were left confused with some other books we tried. The book is easy to read and understand. The only ""problem"" I found is that the examples and short tuts in this book are based on one sepcial database called Northwind which you have to install. The installation into Access was pretty easy though. The information is transferable to other (e.g. your own) databases. I found everything I wanted and needed to know in this book so for me it's a definite rec."
"121","I purchased the Kindle version of this book because I have been using SQL for the past few years but mainly have succeeded by manipulating what has already been created. This company does a good job at writing short intro books which address people who have a baseline understanding of the subject but need to get to the next level. I felt this book was a great help in providing me with the technical terms for specific actions and how to accomplish basic tasks. You will see from many other reviews that they do focus a lot on database creation and manipulation so be prepared to read another book after this if you want to really dive in deeper. That is the only reason I am giving a 4 star since it isn't a well rounded how-to book.

Disclosure: I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my unbiased opinion of the product. I did not get paid to write a review and used the product before I wrote the review. If you feel my review was helpful, make sure to say yes. Thanks for reading!"
"122","Although the book gives no details about setting up a database to practice with, it was simple and easy to understand, making it an effective introduction for me. I tried going through Head First SQL and found it too verbose, and YouTube tutorials always left too many unanswered questions. This book was an effective supplement to other resources and enabled me to pass SQL coding challenges in interviews."
"123","<U+2716>LIKED: Simplicity, detailed, great pictures, well-defined sections, detailed table of contents, allows for jumping to specific sections, great information for beginners as they go through the basics first before explaining the core topics.
<U+2716>DISLIKED: There wasn't that I disliked about the book.

I received this product for free. Great book. I am a current student at unlv and am in the computer science program. I am always hearing about the sql language and how it can be used to store data and be the back end for certain projects. I read through this book and felt like I had a good grasp on SQL. I would definitely recommend it for beginners. I felt the book was pretty detailed and gave really good illustrations for the concepts being discussed. I think this really needed as you want to visualize how the data is being stored. If this book didn't have illustrations like that it, I really wouldn't recommend it for beginners. The table of contents is pretty detailed as well and allows you to skip straight to the section you need. So the book can also be used a reference. The book as a section before chapter 1 where they go over some basic topics and allows the reader to have some backstory to the language. I like the simplicity of the ebook as well. They didn't just put filler stuff in to make it longer, and stick with the basics that needed to be explained which is what I love."
"124","Before getting this book, I didn't have much understanding about SQL and with what you eat it. My friend told me is useful to have some knowledge about it, and I always like to learn new things.
I really liked this book. It's not too long, so don't need spend weeks reading it. You will have all the basic information you need. It's well written and easy to understand. It introduces you to basic things you need to know. I think it's quite good as quick start guide.. It does what it says: you will read it quick, will be able to start fast and if need more insight, will do more studying later on. I would definitely recommend it for beginners like me.
Plus seller gives you free e-book about reading 5 times faster (i think it's quite useful), if you sign up for emails..
Just being honest, price could be lower, like 6.99 (because it's quite small book, only 64 pages).

Full Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Getting this book for free didn't affected my opinion about it."
"125","I had studied SQL in college but after a few years without practicing, Recently I have been searching for a new job in IT and many places require SQL knowledge so I wanted a refresher. This book was much better than the textbooks and study materials that I have because it goes straight to the point and covers most of the basic topics in the SQL language. The examples provided are clear and helpful. One important thing to know about this is that it will not teach you about the multiple SQL implementations like Oracle, Microsoft, MySQL, etc. so you might want to expand on those depending on your needs. In general I think this is a must-have for any IT professional that wants to have a quick reference and any new learner that wants to catch the basics before going deeper into the SQL and database world.

I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. My rating would have been the same even if I had paid full price for it."
"126","There is no way I can get a feeling for how the book is organized and what I might expect from it in terms of learning SQL because the ""look inside"" contains nothing but ""how great I am"" and ""why I decided to write this book"" pages. Not very helpful as to how the book might actually be useful."

Extremely informative! I am an IT professional and I haven't done a lot of Systems administration but I use SQL every day. this really solidified the basics for me and gave me a better understanding of how the server works. Good for anybody whether you are well versed or a beginner this guide breaks it down simply."
"128","I have been a database administrator for over 20 years using all kinds of databases. While this book has a lot of good information in it, I thought it could be organized better. The overview and introduction were great. It explained SQL and RDBMS in very simple terms that so that people with an interest should be able to grasp this concept.

After that the chapters were stuffed full of information, too much information in some cases. I have taught SQL to many people over my career and I always start with the simple structure of select, from, where. This book introduced top rows, top percent, and distinct before even touching the where statement along with the comparison and logical operators. Chapter one also covers operator precedence and joining of tables using joins, inner joins, and outer joins making chapter one more than half of the entire book.

Chapter two was perfect showing built in functions such as count, avg, sum, etc and how to use them with the group by and having clauses. Chapter three covered the DML functions of insert, update, and delete and explained this all very well. Chapter 4 touched on the DDL functions create, drop, and alter tables along with defining the different datatypes for the fields that comprise the tables.

I was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have no relationship or affiliation with the seller. All of my reviews reflect my honest opinion."
"129","It may very well be a great book, but after trying several different ways, I gave up trying to get it to download in a readable format. Whatever happened to .pdf, or a Kindle-ready download? Make it difficult or exclusive to a peculiar format and it will generate a lot less access."
"130","I work with databases on a daily basis, so I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy this book. However, I was very impressed with the way the book continued to build off of previous chapters/exercises. This book does a great job of explaining what databases are and how they are used. It then goes step by step with interactive examples (downloaded with Access support). It covers the basics of select commands, joins, aliases, etc. I know I'll be keeping this book handy in case any quick reference is needed for a stuck SQL query.

I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get started into SQL or even advanced users looking to have a handy reference guide.

"131","""SQL QuickStart Guide"" is actually a great way to learn structured query language. This can be difficult and I would suggest the accompanying material that will be in your library as a PDF along with this audiobook and with this combination one should be able to get a good idea on how this works. It's specific programming language and honestly if someone's a quick learner they could possibly bypass a lengthy tutorial or college course.

Dave Wright's narration was impeccable. It was clear and easy to understand. He walks you through each step and there are enough different examples to where one can pick this up fairly easily. Nice job.

"132","I found this book after slogging through another author's confusing discussion of SQL. This was very helpful, with ""doable"" exercises presented in a thoughtful, well planned sequence. I was glad to get this straightforward introduction, and it was enough to convince me that I will learn to be efficient in database manipulation."
"133","This is a great book for anyone looking to learn the basics of SQL! I have worked with MS SQL in the past and would have loved to have had this book when I was getting started. This book provides great examples on how to get started retrieving, entering, and modifying data as well as performing calculations. From my experience, these functions are what ""most"" people who use SQL deal with on a daily basis. I has been over a year since I have worked directly with SQL and this read was a great refresher course for me.

"134","It is a pretty good reference, gets a bit deep into some of the SQL concepts, but it is a quickstart guide, so I guess that is to be expected. It has some pretty decent explanations on the theory behind the functions of SQL, but in some cases you do just have to trust that some of this works, and that it will function correctly if you call it on your end.

All in all, it is a good introduction, and an excellent reference guide to keep on hand in the event that you happen to forget the syntax on some of the lesser used commands (everything in this book is in the MSSQL syntax). As an SQL admin, I think that this is a good place to start.

"135","Well organized, very easy to follow. Not challenging to pick up and put down and keep your place. I had to go over a couple of the chapters several times to get some of the exercises just right, but overall the material presented in the book isn't too challenging. When you get it right it is really rewarding."
"136","I got this Kindle book so that I can brush up on my SQL skills. I haven't worked with SQL in a couple of years and I don't want to completely lose a very marketable skill. This book takes your through SQL beginning with the basics, I honestly think it does a better job of covering the material than some of my very expensive college books on the subject. The book is very easy to follow and is very informative. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn or brush up on their SQL skills.

"137","The author takes you from ground zero (about where I was) to some really ingenious programming heights. I am already using the techniques learned to help me shave hours off the tasks incumbent on my job duties [read: lawyer]. You can think of a Table of Authorities as just another data base with clearly identifiable ""fields"". So I wrote a few queries that enabled me to generate a list of case citations for every issue confronting me in a current pending Motion for Summary Judgment. Hurrah for SQLite!"
"138","I'm a software engineer and I read this book over 3 days on my Kindle. It's roughly 60 pages. It provides a great introduction to SQL. Was glad to see that it touched upon the concepts of most used queries we perform almost daily at work. I like the way the author explained these concepts. I would however like to see a more advanced edition, which would cover queries in deeper concepts of set theory such as using EXCEPT, INTERSECT clauses and using correlated subqueries. Overall, it was a great read and I will continue to follow this publisher.

"139","This is an easy-to-read intro to SQL that is perfect for the novice or anyone with no technical background. This simplified, quickstart guide is on par with other SQL tutorials that I have found online. Don't expect to become an IT guru overnight, but you will gain a conceptual understanding of what SQL is, and how it works, as well the most common and important commands needed to navigate and communicate within the SQL environment. I definitely recommend this, as it is easy to read and inexpensive. Another great thing about it is that you don't even need a kindle! You can easily download the kindle reading app to your mobile device, as I did.

"140","The book itself is a great little intro, well organized with great, clear examples.

But I really hated the fact that I had to hunt on the net for an (old) version of the database which matches the queries from the book--wasted about 2 hours... The fact that the book nonchalantly sends you to a link which installs the SQL Server 2000 version also doesn't help... I tried downloading the on-line book resources, which of course asked for my email (how else) but except for some aggressive marketing, I didn't get very far.

Obviously, the book's content is dated, and it needs to be brought to shape.

The writers, whioever they are (not mentioned) did a really great job--nice clear writing--so it's really a pity that ClydeBank lets the book age like this...

Should have really been 1 star for the experience..."
"141","I find this book to be easy for me to get a basic understanding of SQL. I'm looking forward to getting a better understanding of SQL. I think it will help me in my career."
"142","I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased review.

I've worked with SQL off and on over the last 10 years or so. As a Backup Administrator I wanted to get a better understanding of SQL and SQL commands because most of my reports are now created using SQL. So far this book has been a big help in clarifying the different commands, especially the joins, and helping to understand what output I will get back when using them. If you need something to get you started quickly with SQL I can definitely recommend this book."
"143","On a scale from 1 to 10 in regard to my SQL knowledge, prior to purchasing this book I was a 1. After reading through this book and going through the exercises (which only took a week of dedication) I would say I am a 5. There is still so much more to learn, but this book is one heck of a start!
The book is very easy to read and the downloadable dataset and the exercises that go along with it are easy to follow as well."
"144","This book has all the information a beginner would need to understand a SQL database. It is written in an easy to understand way with little jargon. Specific terms are defined in a short glossary at the end. The examples and illustrations provide for an even better understanding of what the text is trying to explain. My employer recently migrated our database to SQL and this will be invaluable to me as a quick reference.

I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased and truthful review."
"145","I have this as an audio book and this was a nice listen. The pdf that accompanied the audio book was very detailed and contained good references for SQL commands. This is definitely a starters guide and has very good information. This book defines SQL and its meaning, along with definitions of databases, query, and tables. This book guides you through creating and retriving information from a database. This book tuches on the difference of Microsoft RDBMS and other third party management systems. This is a good audio book and I would reccomend it to a friend."
"146","I came from no SQL experience at all. The book is well written and SQLlite was a great choice for a starter environment. I didn't know where to start my learning path. This book is where to start your learning path, hands down."
"147","DISCLAIMER
I received this product as FREE for my honest and truthful review and opinions, which are being provided below without bias.
USAGE
I have been using SQL queries occasionally and have bought several high end books to study SQL deeply. But was looking for a simple book to teach my son with the basic elements of developing queries and understanding databases and how to understand it with samples.
This has turned out to be just the right beginners guide.
OVERALL
I like it."
"148","Great introduction to SQLite. I needed to learn SQLite for a school assignment. The digital edition fit the bill."
"149","This is great for beginners who don't have any prior experience with databases or SQL. Walter does a great job at explaining how to start using SQL really quickly. Highly recommend! "
"150","Great book. It showed me just what I needed to know to get used to using SQL. It's a great primer and I'm now ready to move onto some really serious data analysis."
"151","wow what a great guide
over 1000pages!
i just started it, but i can tell its covers the topic in depth

"152","This book is the best resource for learning SQL. I recommend anyone who is even slightly interested in SQL to get this book. I literally went from novice to proficient within in weeks. I found myself exploring more about the database that you can access through the complimentary SQL course. I found myself excited about learning SQL because of this system. I highly recommend!!!!"
"153","I deal with data tables a lot at work and this is a great book for me. Its a great trade to have and put on your resume if you aren't in the IT field. Its also great to have it in the iPhone Kindle app so I can pick up where I left off at any time or use it as reference when I am at work. I would recommend reading this to anyone who is interesting in learning SQL and data tables."
"154","I came to this with very little experience coding or otherwise and I had no trouble keeping up with the main thrust of the book. Learning SQL helps me feel like other programming languages and more complex applications aren't that far out of reach. With hands on technical books like this you need lots of pictures, diagrams etc. and this book has no shortage in that department. Graphics are clear, easy to read, and everywhere."
"155","This book takes you step by step, I just wish I read that before my lectures, would have helped a lot! It explains what a database means, how to download a program to use SQLite, and even provides a dummy database for you to use...the book is concise, gets to the point at a nice pace, I highly recommend it for beginners and as a reference for advanced users."
"156","Very easy to follow anyone without a computer coding background can follow this book. The author has done a great job and I am able to follow and code from the very first day. Great buy."
"157","SQL quickstart help to expert as well. Books is good to refresh memory. Few basic step/logic I did long time a go. Read those again with new example really helpful. Book also help with simple example how to tune sql and Simple join mistakes. Reading is always better.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review"
"158","I use databases for work and this book is just what I was looking for to learn how to sort and organize multiple spreadsheets. It is very well organized and a pretty quick read. I will keep it as a reference guide to refer back to. Highly recommend to anyone looking to get into sql.
Although I received this for a discount for an honest review is well worth the price for the electronic version. A++"
"159","Great for people new to SQL. Simply stated and good examples that introduce SQL basics.

Book includes a sample database to run SQL statements so readers can experience the utility of SQL."
"160","I had a little background already in Sql but was looking for a refresher course. It is really only an overview and should have a prerequisite book to explain databases. I think this is good for someone who needs a little more than just a rough concept.

Disclaimer: I got a discount for my honest review."
"161","So far the book holds great promise"
"162","Easy intro to SQL. Provides a good path (software and techniques) to querying databases."
"163","I have just began using this book about a week ago and it is by far the best training manual I have used to date. The instructor explain things in a way that I get it. 5 stars on that alone. I will follow up at the half way mark or once I get through the guide to give my overall opinion."
"164","It was very simple and easy to download this ebook on my Kindle device. The information within is also very interesting and easy to grasp. I now have a new understanding of SQL and how it is utilized by corporations.

I received this for free or at a discount in exchange for an un-biased, honest review."
"165","Very easy to follow with full explanation for someone either refreshing from lack of years of use to a newbie starting."
"166","I am only half way through this book, but I am already writing queries, joining tables, and making cases to return data. It's an awesome step by step guide for anyone hoping to gain the skills necessary to simply return data sets that are relevant to analysis. Love it and would highly recommend it."
"167","I'm familiar with Access database however I'm new to SQL and i found this book to be a really good started to me. I'm an IT Technician and wanted to gain some knowledge on SQL and this was just the perfect book. I recommend this book to anyone new to SQL or wanting to learn about it, this is a great start. I received a free copy of this book for a review and this is my honest opinion of the book.
This is a wonderful book."
"168","I liked everything about it"
"169","Having absolutely no knowledge of SQL, this did a great job explaining. I highly recommend it!!"
"170","I am half way through this informational book. SQL is explained in the ideal manner! Easy to understand, all vocab is explained using non technical terms. As a web developer I would use this book to teach SQL to partners and beginners. The format of this book is easy to read, and you do not have to be an English major to understand to text. Error Team Web Dev will be purchasing atleast 5 copies. This book competes with others in my paperback library.

"175","A nice introduction on what exactly is SQL. It covers all the basic information and if you are new at it you will be able to understand and comprehend the book without any major misunderstanding of what the author is taking about."
"176","I'm about half-way through the book and I'm impressed on the interface with the text and the downloaded files. Great SQL instructions."

"190","So far I am able to understand and do the exercises.

Easy to understand

Let’s see if I would need to order an advanced level book for SQL or not."
"191","This is one of the best books of all times among those I have read. Other than reading, it gives you an opportunity to download the SQL database and platform to practice what you have learned, and makes what you have learned to stick, never to forget. It is written in very simple language even for a beginner to understand. I am doing the last two topics, in reading and writing SQL queries. It also gives you challenge tasks to complete, relevant to the the topic you will have covered. It has all the solutions at the back for reference where you may have gone wrong, and you could redo the assignment until you master. I have read so many SQL books, but they never give you projects to practice what you have learned. It has solidified my knowledge on SQL. It covers exhaustively what you would expect in a working environment. However, I just missed the stored procedures, but has Views which close to stored procedures. Please get a copy if you need to start off learning SQL or polish your knowledge. I have given it a five stars."
"192","Awesome Book and Well written"
"193","SQL Quickstart Guide is a good book if you are a beginner with MSSQL. It gives a nice and easy to understand overview of MSSQL, coding and queries, examples, and more. I have worked with MSSQL databases for years now but going back to the basics sometimes is a good thing as it reminds you of some things which can be done and how, or at least the basics of how and then you can build on them. I would not have an issue RECOMMENDING THIS BOOK to other users who are trying to get a bit more techie and expand their knowledge of what can be done with MSSQL and the data.

I received a copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review. My opinions are my own."
"194","On the positive side, there are good, simple, easy to follow examples of most key ""how to get started"" SQL questions. So this is a good way to get a clear set of examples including example tables of how queries work etc. However, many examples move in one step from dead simple to pretty complex, and the intermediate steps are not clear.
This isn't an easy subject to simplify, and as a basic guide it's OK, but I only gave it 3 stars because of the cheesy sales process related to the so called ""online assets"" the publishers push you to download.
This is really cheeky, as the link simply pushes their training services, and directs you to a Microsoft SQL resources website, to download a readily available microsoft SQL training database. Will never touch their stuff again."
"195","Poorly written, lack of sql content deemed as basic. There is a number of mistakes in the book that will likely confuse and discourage a number of readers who are about to start their db journey. Therefore I cannot recommend this book to anyone, and certainly not at this price."
"196","Simple to follow along and well-written. I work with data every day as part of my job and would say that it's helpful for both beginners and experts looking to brush up on SQL and understanding of relational databases. Well worth the money spent."
"197","Very Very basic, very short. Find something else dont spend your money on this!"
"198","Excellent book for beginners"
"199","good"
"200","A nice straight forward introduction / guide to using the main components of the SQL language, written in a straightforward manner."
"201","This is a great introduction to SQL.

- It explains all of the key concepts. For example, basic select statements, joins, functions, and nested queries.
- It is concise and to the point.
- It is very well written and easy to read/understand.

If you are looking for an introduction to SQL or want to refresh your knowledge (like me) this is a great book."
"202","Concise overview without too much repetition. This book provides a perfect overview to get started without prior knowledge in Sql with many examples and schemas. The material a of the whole course is very complete."
"203","A nice introduction on what exactly is SQL. It covers all the basic information and if you are new at it you will be able to understand and comprehend the book without any major misunderstanding of what the author is taking about."
"204","If you are looking to brish up on SQL this is a good book to have."
"205","Super good"
"206","Loved the book. It's really cheap and contained all the material I needed to know for my job."
"207","the book is clearly structured and easy to understand even for beginners. It focuses on what is relevant."
"208","Very effective"
"209","Good"
